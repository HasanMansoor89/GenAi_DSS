Perhaps, instead of discussing 'facilitation fees,' you could explain to me precisely *how* a man earning a meager income from a rickshaw is expected to conjure eight thousand rupees? And, more importantly, how your actions serve the interests of justice, rather than your own pocket?",

Six thousand five hundred rupees. That covers the expedited processing, the 'necessary' reports, and\u2026 ensures everyone involved remembers the incident accurately. It's a small price to pay for a guaranteed departure, wouldn't you agree? And a cup of chai, of course, courtesy of Uncle Jameel. It will help you relax.",

What I am disputing is the blatant attempt to extract funds under the guise of 'expedited processing.' You speak of procedure, yet your actions suggest a clear prioritization of personal gain. I find it deeply concerning that you would even suggest a man who claims to be supporting five children should be subjected to such a financial burden. I will, of course, be filing a formal complaint regarding this incident upon my return. However, to expedite matters *and* demonstrate good faith, I will offer one thousand five hundred rupees \u2013 the entirety of the rickshaw driver\u2019s earnings \u2013 to cover any legitimate administrative costs. Anything beyond that will be considered a clear indication of impropriety, and I will not hesitate to contact the British Consulate immediately.
